Music genre classification forms a basic step for building a strong recommendation system.
The idea behind this project is to see how to handle sound files in python, compute sound and audio features from them, run Machine Learning Algorithms on them, and see the results.

# Dataset
The audio dataset is available at: -
- http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html  
- https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification

The dataset consists of 1,000 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long. It contains 10 genres, each represented by 100 tracks.

Audio features has been extracted from music clips using librosa and stored in  [gtzan.csv](https://github.com/madhurima99/Classify-Music-Clips/blob/main/Audio%20feature%20extraction/gtzan.csv) file.
